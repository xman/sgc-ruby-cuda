Release Notes for v0.1.0:

GPU has a huge potential to compute intensive applications as CPU is getting
limited by the power wall and memory wall. Programming GPU has been difficult
in the past with OpenGL. With the emerge of CUDA C API, GPU programming becomes
much more accessible for generic applications.

Although CUDA C API has been available for several years, its supports for Ruby
bindings have not been established. As Ruby programming is becoming more
popular, it would be nice to have access to the CUDA C API from a Ruby program.

This is the first release of SGC Ruby CUDA supporting basic CUDA Driver and
Runtime API. It re-organizes CUDA C API functions into Object-Oriented API. It
uses exception classes to simplify error detection and handling. The class names
and method names are kept close to the original naming in CUDA C SDK so anyone
familiar with CUDA C API can pick up SGC Ruby CUDA without much effort.

We hope this release could trigger the interest of all Rubyists to check out GPU
programming as well as the interest of all HPC developers to explore using Ruby
for HPC applications.

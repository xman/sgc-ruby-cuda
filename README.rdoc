== Welcome to SGC-Ruby-CUDA

SGC-Ruby-CUDA implements Ruby bindings to Nvidia CUDA SDK. It provides easy
access to CUDA-enabled GPU from a Ruby program.

SGC-Ruby-CUDA is incomplete in many ways. Currently, it supports only some
crucial CUDA Driver API functions. We aim to include the supports for most CUDA
Driver API and CUDA Runtime API functions.

SGC-Ruby-CUDA is tested on 64bit Fedora 13. We have not tested it against
32bit Linux OS and Windows. We certainly wish to improve the code base to
support multiple platforms in the future.

== Design philosophy

The Ruby bindings, Ruby CUDA API, which deal directly with Nvidia CUDA SDK C/C++
bindings retain the CUDA Driver and Runtime API in a systematic way whenever
possible. This facilitates developers familiar with CUDA C who should be able to
use SGC-Ruby-CUDA with minimum effort.

Ruby classes and methods to ease the use of the API or making CUDA the
Ruby way would be built on top of the Ruby CUDA API.


== Prerequisites

* Ruby         (Tested with Ruby 1.9.2)
* CUDA Toolkit (Tested with CUDA Toolkit 3.1)
* C++ compiler (Tested with GCC 4.5.1)
